Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of calls to knows.

Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.

/* The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
      boolean knows(int a, int b); */

public class Solution extends Relation {
    public int findCelebrity(int n) {
        if(n < 2) {
            return -1;
        }
        int found = 0;
        //如果他知道了i，他就不可能是，就就更新found
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(knows(found, i)) {
                found = i;
            }
        }
        //找到之后检查，如果found直到别人或者别人不知道found，就不合法return -1， 反之符合条件的return found
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(i != found) {
                if(knows(found, i) || !knows(i, found)) {
                    return -1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return found;
    }
}
